### Collaboration Ready
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on open-source that have as main areas the ones listed on the top of this page since I would like to have hands-on skills in this type of fields. I am also interested in supporting/ volunteering with NGOs that have as goal to bring digital and computer literacy to the society.

#### üì´ HOW TO REACH ME: 
 There are some options in reaching me, although the most direct one is Twitter. Please when sending emails, stay respectful. Here are some of the hints to avoid being confused with my spam detection eyes:
 
 - header with a clear statement ( volunteering :no_entry_sign: ; volunteering for position x at company/ngo y :heavy_check_mark:)
 - email should be professionally made ( :no_entry_sign: no need for domain, but not email in the form of superhero, non-name words etc...) 
 - check typos and spelling in the email content, will disregard if I see low email writing commitment
 - no friendly words ( I do not know you, stay professional)
